# Employee-Absenteeism-Analysis

This project explores employee absenteeism patterns using a real-world dataset from Kaggle as part of a learning simulation at Vephla University. The goal was to analyze, visualize, and derive actionable insights from factors influencing absenteeism in the workplace.

## Project Description

The analysis focuses on the dependent variable Absenteeism Time in Hours, which represents the amount of time employees are absent from work. A wide range of independent variables are considered, including behavioral factors (smoking, drinking), demographics (age, education, BMI), workplace logistics (distance to work, transport cost), and operational metrics (hit target, workload). To improve clarity, the data was enhanced in Power BI by converting coded values into readable categories such as Absence Month, Weekday, Reason for Absence, BMI Status, and Education Status.

## Key Outcomes

The total absenteeism time recorded was 5,010 hours across 740 absences, averaging 6.98 hours per event. The analysis showed that absenteeism peaked in March and July, with a significant decline by January. Mondays and Tuesdays had the highest absence hours, while diagnosed medical conditions were the most common reason for absence.

Employees with high school education contributed the most to total absence hours. Although normal weight employees accounted for the majority of absentee hours, a notable portion came from overweight and obese categories. Drinker status was not a significant driver, as over 92% of employees were non-drinkers.

## Summary of Insights

Absenteeism decreases consistently over time, with early-week days showing the highest hours.

Health-related reasons dominate causes of absence, especially diagnosed medical conditions.

Lower education and higher BMI groups show greater absence tendencies.

Behavioral factors like drinking had minimal influence on absence totals.

Routine medical appointments and unjustified absences still contribute to time lost.

## Recommendations

Implement wellness programs to address medical and BMI-related absenteeism.

Introduce flexible scheduling or early-week engagement strategies.

Provide targeted support for lower-educated employee segments.

Offer on-site or subsidized access to routine health consultations.

Focus resources on impactful drivers like medical conditions and workload, rather than low-impact factors like drinker status.
